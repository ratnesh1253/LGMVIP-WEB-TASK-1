## To-Do List Web App

Welcome to the To-Do List web app! This project was created during my web development internship to showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Project Goals
The goal of this project was to develop a user-friendly to-do list web app that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently.

### Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Features
- Add tasks to your to-do list
- Mark tasks as completed with a strikethrough effect
- Delete completed tasks
- Responsive design for optimal user experience

### Development Process
I followed an agile development process, starting with wireframing and progressively enhancing the app's features and functionality. The app is built from scratch using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Usage Instructions
1. Enter a task in the input box.
2. Click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list.
3. Click the "Complete" button to mark a task as completed (and remove the strikethrough if it's already completed).
4. Click the "Delete" button to remove a task from the list.

### Future Enhancements
I plan to add user authentication and the ability to save tasks across sessions in future updates.

Feel free to explore and use this web app for your task management needs. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out!
